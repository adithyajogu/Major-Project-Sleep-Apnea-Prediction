# Deep Learning of Facial Depth Maps for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Prediction

This project uses deep learning techniques to predict Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) based on facial depth maps. The model leverages 3D facial data to identify patterns associated with OSA, potentially aiding early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: The main implementation is in the Jupyter notebook:
  - `Deep Learning of Facial Depth Maps for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Prediction.ipynb`

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Clone the repository.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open the notebook and run all cells.

Dataset
This project assumes access to a dataset of 3D facial depth maps labeled with OSA severity or binary labels.

Model
The model processes facial depth maps and outputs a prediction indicating the likelihood of OSA. It may use CNNs and facial region segmentation to enhance prediction accuracy.

Output
OSA classification or severity score
